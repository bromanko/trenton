# Project Planning

This project is a personal data pipeline. It aggregates information
across a variety of sources and persists that data for analysis.

The webhooks will store data in it's raw format in CloudStorage. Any
further manipulation can be done downstream.

So, this project will be a simple webhook -> CloudFunctions mapping.
It should be very simple to create a new endpoint.
